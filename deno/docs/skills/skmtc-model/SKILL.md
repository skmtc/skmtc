# Model generators: fill the skeleton

A **model generator** turns each component schema (`refName`) into one
definition in one file: entry → projection → schema-type router → one
snippet class per schema type. That structure is invariant across
target libraries — only naming policy and per-type syntax vary. So do
not write the structure: copy it.

## 1. The method

The `skeleton/` directory next to this file is a complete, compiling,
engine-tested model generator that renders a placeholder syntax
(`m.object({...})`). Author by transplant, not from scratch:

1. **Copy** `skeleton/` to your package location; run
   `deno test --allow-env --allow-sys --allow-read` — 6 green tests
   prove the machinery before you touch anything.
2. **Rename**: `name` in `deno.json`; `MyLib` → `YourLib` in class
   names and filenames; `myLibEntry` → `yourLibEntry`; then
   `src/lib.ts` — `LIB_MODULE` (emitted module specifier) and `LIB`
   (imported symbol).
3. **Fill the slots** (§2), smallest first: scalars → string/enum →
   array/object → union → lazy/recursion annotation.
4. **Re-pin the test**: update the pinned strings in `mod.test.ts` to
   your target syntax. The structural assertions (files exist, shared
   refs dedup to ONE definition, import headers stitched, recursion
   annotated) must pass UNCHANGED — if one breaks, you broke machinery,
   not syntax.

Every slot is a `// SLOT(name):` comment. Everything outside a SLOT is
engine machinery — modifying it is almost always a mistake.

## 2. The slots

| Slot | File | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `library` | `src/lib.ts` | emitted module + symbol, single point |
| `naming`, `identifier-kind`, `export-path` | `src/base.ts` | identity policy (from `refName` ONLY) |
| `string`, `string-constraints` | `src/MyLibString.ts` | string / enum / literal syntax; formats, min/maxLength |
| `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `unknown`, `void` | `src/MyLibScalars.ts` | scalar syntax; numeric constraints |
| `array` | `src/MyLibArray.ts` | list syntax |
| `object-properties`, `object-intersection`, `object-empty`, `visibility` | `src/MyLibObject.ts` | object syntax; properties+record composition; readOnly/writeOnly policy |
| `record` | `src/MyLibObject.ts` | additionalProperties map syntax |
| `union` | `src/MyLibUnion.ts` | oneOf/anyOf; discriminated form |
| `lazy` | `src/MyLibRef.ts` | deferred-reference form for cycles |
| `recursion-annotation` | `src/MyLibProjection.ts` | type annotation breaking circular inference |
| `modifiers` | `src/modifiers.ts` | optional/nullable syntax and wrap order |
| `enrichments` | `src/enrichments.ts` | config seam (default: opt-out) |

## 3. Edge cases the skeleton already handles — keep them working

- **Refs are names, never expansions.** `MyLibRef` puts only the peer's
  NAME in the value tree; the `ModelDriver` resolves the definition
  (cache hit → reuse, miss → construct) and stitches the cross-file
  import. Inline-expanding a ref, or hand-writing its import, is how
  shared models duplicate.
- **Recursion is a protocol, not a special case.** A back-reference to
  a model still open on the build stack (`context.modelDepth` > 0)
  renders via SLOT(lazy) and bumps the depth; the projection then sees
  `> 1` and sets `settings.identifier.typeName` (SLOT
  recursion-annotation) so the emitted `export const` doesn't die of
  circular inference (TS7022/7024). Self-recursion only — mutual
  recursion is not detected.
- **Optional and nullable are different axes.** `required` comes from
  the PARENT object's `required` list and flows into each property
  leaf's `modifiers`; `nullable` sits on the node itself. Both render
  exactly once, in `applyModifiers`, at the leaf — no other owner, and
  never while building stored fields.
- **additionalProperties** → the record path; `true`/empty schema →
  the unknown fallback; properties + additionalProperties together →
  SLOT(object-intersection).
- **An object schema has four forms — and position can change the
  render.** Properties-only, record-only (additionalProperties), both,
  empty: every place an object renders must survive all four. In
  TypeScript one expression serves both type and declaration positions
  (`z.object({...})`, `.and(z.record(...))` for both-forms), so the
  object SLOTs compose freely. In a head+value language (Kotlin) the
  two positions DIVERGE, and a position-blind `toString()` cannot serve
  both (compiler-verified 2026-08-04, kotlin-debug rig): properties-only
  declares as a `data class` parameter list, and in type position must
  render a NAME — synthesize the named sibling declaration and
  reference it (name derived from the schema's own `stackTrail`, no
  naming param threaded through the router; collisions policed by a
  document-wide claim registry that throws per-item, since the name
  shares a PACKAGE with every component class — gen-kotlin-jackson
  `toSynthesizedName.ts` + `synthesizedNames.ts`; a parameter list in
  type position parses as a function type and fails, and widening to
  `Map<String, Any?>` discards the type — capitulation, not a
  solution); record-only and empty
  must not take a data-class head at all (`data class X()` is illegal —
  their declaration kind is `typealias`); both-forms has a declaration
  form (data class plus a `@field:JsonAnySetter @get:JsonAnyGetter`
  catch-all map property) but no anonymous type form. Decide the
  identifier KIND and the value together from the same schema guards
  (gen-kotlin-jackson `shape.ts` is the worked example) — never from
  the name alone, and never by making one `toString()` answer both
  positions.
- **A discriminated union may be a DECLARATION, not an expression.**
  In TypeScript SLOT(union) is one expression
  (`z.discriminatedUnion("type", [...])`). In a language without union
  types (Kotlin) a qualifying discriminated union becomes a named
  `sealed` declaration, and the member models must declare the
  supertype — a member may be BUILT before its union is ever seen, so
  membership comes from a document-wide scan (parent → member
  inversion, WeakMap-memoized) consulted at member construction, never
  from the union's own walk. Non-qualifying unions render the honest
  wire type (`JsonNode`), not `Any`. Full pattern: the Kotlin lang
  skill §8c.
- **Property keys** go through `handleKey` — `'first-name'` renders
  quoted; never assume keys are identifiers.
- **Visibility.** `readOnly`/`writeOnly` are captured per property in
  `MyLibObjectProperties.visibility`. Default policy ignores them; if
  the target needs them, annotate the value (e.g. `.readonly()`) or
  emit request/response variants via `variant` threading — decide at
  SLOT(visibility).
- **Unknown never throws.** Untyped schemas route to the unknown
  fallback so one odd schema can't kill the subject. `custom` values
  pass through untouched.
- **TypeSystem contracts.** Each snippet class carries the fields peers
  rely on (`TypeSystemString` needs `format` + `enums`; objects expose
  `objectProperties`/`recordProperties`). Add fields freely; remove
  none — removal breaks `insertNormalizedModel` consumers and fails the
  `SchemaToValueFn` check.

## 4. Verify

The shipped `mod.test.ts` runs the REAL pipeline (`toArtifacts`) over a
fixture with an enum, an array-of-ref, a shared ref (×2 → one
definition), optional + nullable, a record, and a self-recursive model.
It is your regression gate: green before you start, green after every
slot. Read failures in this order: import header first (a missing
import means a string swallowed a snippet), then the body, then
`deno lint` (the `skmtc/*` rules are wired in `deno.json`).

## 5. Model-generator pitfalls

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Shared model duplicated per consumer | A ref was rendered/expanded instead of flowing through `MyLibRef` |
| Stack overflow on recursive schema | The `modelDepth` branch in `MyLibRef` was removed or bypassed |
| Emitted file dies of TS7022/7024 | SLOT(recursion-annotation) not set for the target |
| `.optional()` doubled or missing | Modifiers applied outside `applyModifiers`, or a second owner added |
| Enum with `null` member renders `'null'` | Keep the `literal()` null-guard from `MyLibString` |
| Peer generator can't consume yours | `schemaToValueFn`/`createIdentifier` statics or TypeSystem contract fields removed |
| Lint fires `no-template-imports`/`no-adhoc-tostring` | Target syntax leaked outside a `toString()` body — move it into the SLOT |
| `data class NameMap<String, Any?>` (head glued to a type) in output | Declaration kind and value were decided separately — see the four-forms bullet in §3; kind+value must come from the same schema guards |

## 6. Boundaries

Engine semantics (the one law, memoization, enrichments, variants,
naming rules) live in **skmtc-generator** — read it first. TS-layer
specifics (register shapes, identifier kinds, import machinery,
`List`/`FunctionParameter`) live in **skmtc-lang-typescript**. This
skill owns only the model SHAPE. The skeleton is TypeScript-emitting;
for a Kotlin model generator, keep this skill's shape and edge-case
rules but take call shapes from the Kotlin lang skill (no Kotlin
skeleton yet). Operation generators are a different shape — load
`skmtc-operation`; accumulators are covered by neither (clone
`gen-msw`/`gen-express` per skmtc-generator §2).
