CodeSquared is a TypeScript code generation platform that lets you automate software development.

It lets you create powerful code generators, upload them to CodeSquared and run them using any OpenAPI schema.

If you are building a Saas product and need to provide a dashboard for your users, CodeSquared
can save you months of work by letting you create generators for components like
forms and tables then generating from your OpenAPI schema.

See docs at [docs.codesquared.com](https://docs.codesquared.com) for a 5 minute quickstart tutorial.
