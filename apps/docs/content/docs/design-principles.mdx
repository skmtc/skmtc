## Immediate

Code generation is runnable at the click of a button from inside the IDE and generated artifacts can be used immediately.

## Modular

Developers define outputs as re-usable packages. Parsing, structure and rendering is handled by the framework.

## Flexible

Specifying and updating output code is simple and does not require advanced level skills.
