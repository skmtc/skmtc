# SchemaToTypeSystemMap

Mapping of schema types to their type system representations.

This type maps OpenAPI schema types to their corresponding type system
value types, enabling type-safe transformations during code generation.


## Example

```typescript
// Used internally by the type system transformation process
type StringOutput = SchemaToTypeSystemMap['string']['output']; // TypeSystemString
type RefSource = SchemaToTypeSystemMap['ref']['source']; // OasRef<'schema'>
```

## Type Definition

```typescript
type SchemaToTypeSystemMap = unknown
```
