# Method

TypeScript type representing valid HTTP methods.

This union type includes all HTTP methods supported by OpenAPI v3 operations.
It's used throughout the codebase for type safety when working with API methods.


## Example

```typescript
import { Method } from '@skmtc/core';

function processOperation(method: Method, path: string) {
  switch (method) {
    case 'get':
      return handleGet(path);
    case 'post':
      return handlePost(path);
    // ... handle other methods
    default:
      // TypeScript ensures exhaustive checking
      const _exhaustive: never = method;
      throw new Error(`Unhandled method: ${method}`);
  }
}
```

## Type Definition

```typescript
type Method = unknown
```
