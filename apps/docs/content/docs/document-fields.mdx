# DocumentFields

Fields that define the structure of an OpenAPI v3 document.

This type represents the normalized structure of an OpenAPI document after
parsing, with operations flattened from the nested paths structure into
a simple array for easier processing.

## Type Definition

```typescript
type DocumentFields = {
  openapi: string
  info: OasInfo
  servers?: OasServer[] | undefined
  operations: OasOperation[]
  components?: OasComponents | undefined
  tags?: OasTag[] | undefined
  security?: OasSecurityRequirement[] | undefined
  extensionFields?: Record
}
```
