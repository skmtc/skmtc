# OasUnknown

Object representing an unknown type in the OpenAPI Specification.

JSON schema treats a definition without any type information as 'any'.
Since this is not useful in an API context, we use OasUnknown to
represent types that are not specified.

## Class Definition

### Constructors

- `constructor(...)`

### Properties

- `oasType: schema`
- `type: unknown`
- `title: string | undefined`
- `description: string | undefined`
- `extensionFields: Record | undefined`
- `example: unknown | undefined`

### Methods

- `isRef(): this is OasRef\<"schema"\>`
- `resolve(): OasUnknown`
- `resolveOnce(): OasUnknown`
- `toJsonSchema(_options?: ToJsonSchemaOptions): OpenAPIV3.NonArraySchemaObject | OpenAPIV3.ArraySchemaObject`
