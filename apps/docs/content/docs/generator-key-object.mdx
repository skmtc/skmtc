# GeneratorKeyObject

Object representation of a parsed GeneratorKey.

This discriminated union type represents the parsed components of any
generator key, making it easier to work with key data in a structured way.
The `type` field discriminates between the three key types.

## Type Definition

```typescript
type GeneratorKeyObject = {
  type: operation
  generatorId: string
  path: string
  method: Method
} | {
  type: model
  generatorId: string
  refName: string
} | {
  type: generator-only
  generatorId: string
}
```
