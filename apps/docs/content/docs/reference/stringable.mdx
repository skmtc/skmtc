title: Stringable
description: Represent any object as a string
---

A **Stringable** is any object that implements a custom `toString()` method to output itself
as a string. CodeSquared uses this pattern to specify how to convert a value into output code.

For example, let's say we have an [OasOperation](/open-api/operation) object and we want to 
use to generate an HTML form. We can do it using Stringables by doing something like `Form`
code below.

```js
class Form {
  path: string;

  constructor(operation: OasOperation){
    this.path = operation.path;
    this.method = operation.method;
  }

  toString() {
    return `<form action="${this.operation.path}" method="${this.operation.method}">
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>`
  }
}
```

Using Stringables gives several benefits

- They are **easy to read** since each template looks similar to the code it will output.
- They are **unopinionated** and let you decide how to you structure your data or your outputs.
- Object properties remain accessible. For example, we can easily get the values of `path` and `method`
from a Form instance. Had we converted the operation to a string
- Stringables can be nested inside each other allowing us to compose complex code structures
- Fast
