## Why use CodeSquared?

- **Competitive advantage**: CodeSquared helps ship and iterate faster,
shortening the time to market and finding product market fit.

- **Consistency**: customers expect a consistent and intuitive experience that
is easier to deliver via automation rather than manual processes

- **Instant updates**: code generation can eliminate bugs due to API
changes by automatically generating updated UI code

- **Developer focus**: engineer attention is finite and best applied to
driving business outcomes rather than toil

## How is CodeSquared different from other code generation solutions

**Ease of output code customisation**

We believe that creating a code generator should be as easy as writing
output code directly.

The API CodeSquared uses to define output code closely resembles string
templates. This makes them much easier to understand and customise to
suit your exact needs.

In contrast, all code generators in use today are designed to produce
a single output such as docs, client code or an SDK. They allow limited 
customisation via pre-defined settings, but making specific customisations
is non-trivial.

**Combining and composing generator outputs**

CodeSquared allows generators to refer to each other's output code using
a process we call stacking. Want your Tanstack Query code to import 
Zod types produced by another generator? Not a problem. CodeSquared will
ensure that generated code gets assembled in correct order and all
dependencies are satisfied.

This is a powerful concept since it allows entire apps to be created by
chain generating code from router, to table or form pages, to api client code.

Other code generation tools are designed to be standalone units. Each is
built using different libraries and principles. While we can manually
write code that uses their outputs, it is not possible to use the output
code of one generator inside another.

**Control over naming and output file structure**

Sensible naming conventions and a logical file structure make a codebase
much easier to navigate by providing context and reducing cognitive load. 
CodeSquared provides full control over output code variable names and file
paths. It also supports overriding automatically generated names when
necessary.

Other code generators tend to use hard coded naming conventions write all
output code to a single file. This can often result in generated variable
names that take up an entire line and output code that cannot be easily
split up as we try to modularise a large codebase.

**Usage methodology**

We see CodeSquared as a tool for every day developer use in contrast to
existing code generation products that are intended to run within a CI/CD
environment and rarely if ever change.

As we have been developing CodeSquared, we found great value in being
able to make quick adjustments to generators, produce code for new api endpoints
and commit results to Github. Being able to describe our own code structure
within generators has allowed us to instantly add code that follows all
existing conventions while being less likely to introduce bugs.


## How does CodeSquared compare to AI code generation products

We intend CodeSquared to be a peer to Github Copilot and Cursor, but with
one important distinction. We believe that using a programming language 
to specify outputs provides performance, precision and scalability that AI
is unlikely to match.

We also envision CodeSquared as a tool to help intermediate to advanced level
developers scale their output in a safe, predictable manner. AI on the other
hand can be a tool that makes programming easier and more accessible.

We see CodeSquared and AI tools as complementary to each other.
Using Cursor or Github Copilot has helped us ship generators faster.
They provide suggestion and remove the need to manually write predictable
code. CodeSquared on the other hand has allowed us to deterministically
generate apps with over 50k lines of code in just over a second.
