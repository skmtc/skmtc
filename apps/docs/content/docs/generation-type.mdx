# GenerationType

'force' - will generate content even it is not selected.
Use this option when generating code via a dependency.
For example, when you are generating a form and it needs
an accompanying API client as well. You should use 'force'
when generating the API client to ensure it is generated
event the API client itself is not selected.

'regular' - will generate content only if it is selected.

## Type Definition

```typescript
type GenerationType = unknown
```
