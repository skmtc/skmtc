# toTotalTime

Calculates the total generation time from the manifest timestamps.

This function computes the duration of the generation process by
calculating the difference between the end and start timestamps
recorded in the manifest. The result is in milliseconds.


**@param** manifest - The generation manifest with timing information

**@returns** Total generation time in milliseconds


## Example

```typescript
const manifest = {
  startAt: 1672531200000, // January 1, 2023 00:00:00 GMT
  endAt: 1672531245000,   // January 1, 2023 00:00:45 GMT
  // ... other manifest properties
};

const duration = toTotalTime(manifest);
console.log(duration); // 45000 (45 seconds)
console.log(`${duration / 1000}s`); // "45s"
```

## Variable Definition

```typescript
const toTotalTime: (manifest: ManifestContent) =\> number
```
