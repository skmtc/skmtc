# OperationDriver

Driver class for generating operation-based artifacts from OpenAPI operations.

The `OperationDriver` manages the transformation of OpenAPI operation objects
into code artifacts, handling path generation, identifier resolution, and
definition management. It serves as the core orchestrator for operation-based
code generation in the SKMTC pipeline.


**@template** - Type of generated values produced by this driver

**@template** - Type of generation strategy (e.g., 'function', 'class', 'hook')

**@template** - Type of enrichments that can be applied


## Example

Basic usage in an operation generator
```typescript
class APIClientGenerator extends OperationBase {
  generate() {
    const driver = new OperationDriver({
      context: this.context,
      insertable: this,
      operation: this.operation,
      generation: 'function'
    });

    const functionCode = driver.definition.toValueString();
    const file = this.createFile(functionCode);
    this.register({ file });
  }
}
```
