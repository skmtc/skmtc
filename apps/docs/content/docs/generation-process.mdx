title: Generation process
description: How CodeSquared creates code
---

CodeSquared run code generation as three separate phases **parse**, **generate** and **render**.

Parsing and rendering is handled by the framework which lets developers focus purely on
specifying the output code they would like to generate.

## Parse

To make working with contents of an OpenAPI schema easier, we begin code generation by parsing
the schema and converting it to internal objects.

This lets us enrich the objects with additional, useful data. For example, our version of 
Operation also has API `path` and `method` properties added since we refer to them in
nearly every use case.

We also add methods to look up references at runtime and simplify common operations such
as getting the parameters of an API operation.

We group API schema contents into two object categories: **operations** which represent 
API operations and **models** which are data type schemas defined as references that
have their own name.

## Generate

During the **generate** process, CodeSquared uses developer provided generators to convert
operations and models into Files.

This is where CodeSquared stands out from other code generators. Rather than only generating
a single set of pre-defined outputs, Sktmc lets developers specify the code they want
to output using TypeScript packages called **generators**.

Generators can be one of two types **operations** and **models**.

### Operation generators

Operation generators convert operation objects into code which interacts with that
particular API operation. For example, one generator could be responsible for generating
forms that submit data to POST or PUT api endpoints.

### Model generators

Model generators are more specialised and are used to convert JSON schema type defintions
to type definitions you can use in your code. For example, tt can be TypeScript types or 
a type defined by a third party library such as Zod.

### Stringable

When code is generated it is represented as a [Stringable](/stringable) object. It is any 
object with a custom `toString()` method which when called returns a string representation
of the object. We use this `toString()` method where we define how a piece of data gets
converted to corresponding code.

### Files

To make generated code usable, CodeSquared combines each [Stringable](/stringable) value with an
[Identifier](/identifier) to create a [Definition](/definition). 




### Dependency handling

Often the artifacts produced by one generator depend on artifacts produced by another
generator. In these cases CodeSquared will prioritise generation of the dependency if it is not
already created and reuse them
