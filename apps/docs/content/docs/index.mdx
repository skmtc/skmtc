Have you ever found yourself reading RESTful API docs and wishing they
could be automatically turned into YOUR code? Code that took its structure
from the API but used your conventions and your libraries. If so, you've
come to the right place.

## What is CodeSquared?

CodeSquared is a TypeScript code generation system. It lets you automate
the repetitive aspects of front end development and ship typesafe
code fast. It works by providing you with a simple way to create
code generators that convert OpenAPI schemas to TypeScript.

You can control the entire process using our VS Code extension that helps
create generators, configure them and securely run them. Generated
code can be committed to Git alongside developer written code to ensure it
goes through the same code review and CI/CD process.

## Installation

Install **CodeSquared** VS Code extension from [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=skmtc.skmtc-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=skmtc.skmtc-vscode)

## Deno

**CodeSquared** runs on Deno. It is a secure runtime for TypeScript, which does
not require a separate build step.

You can install it on Mac/Linux by running

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

Or on Windows by running

```sh
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

You should also install the Deno VS Code extension for a better development experience. It is available
from [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
